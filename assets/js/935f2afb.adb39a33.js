Otomi can be seen as any other Kubernetes application or add-on, with the difference that Otomi is pre-configured and offers a higher abstraction of configuration for all the integrated solutions. All integrated applications can however be used freely, meaning that a user can benefit from the pre-configuration to start using the offered applications.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"for-ops/sre/troubleshooting":{"id":"for-ops/sre/troubleshooting","title":"SRE Troubleshooting Checklist","description":"Pods not starting","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"for-ops/sre/upgrades":{"id":"for-ops/sre/upgrades","title":"Upgrades","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"get-started/activation":{"id":"get-started/activation","title":"Activation steps","description":"Follow the steps below to activate Otomi after initial installation.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"get-started/chart":{"id":"get-started/chart","title":"Install from chart","description":"Use Helm to install Otomi."},"get-started/installation":{"id":"get-started/installation","title":"Installation","description":"Install Otomi with Helm","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"get-started/optional":{"id":"get-started/optional","title":"Optional configuration","description":"You can optionally configure Otomi to use an external IDP (Azure AD), use an external Key Management Service (KMS) provider for SOPS and use a DNS zone in combination with LetsEncrpt certificates.
