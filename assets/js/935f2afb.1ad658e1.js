Otomi can be seen as any other Kubernetes application or add-on, with the difference that Otomi is pre-configured and offers a higher abstraction of configuration for all the integrated solutions. All integrated applications can however be used freely, meaning that a user can benefit from the pre-configuration to start using the offered applications.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"for-ops/sre/troubleshooting":{"id":"for-ops/sre/troubleshooting","title":"SRE Troubleshooting Checklist","description":"Pods not starting","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"for-ops/sre/upgrades":{"id":"for-ops/sre/upgrades","title":"Upgrades","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"installation/activation":{"id":"installation/activation","title":"Activation steps","description":"After Otomi is installed, Drone needs to be activated.
