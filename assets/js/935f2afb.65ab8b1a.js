Otomi can be seen as any other Kubernetes application or add-on, with the difference that Otomi is pre-configured and offers a higher abstraction of configuration for all the integrated solutions. All integrated applications can however be used freely, meaning that a user can benefit from the pre-configuration to start using the offered applications.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"sre-troubleshooting":{"id":"sre-troubleshooting","title":"SRE Troubleshooting Checklist","description":"Pods not starting","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"tutorial-1-basic-install":{"id":"tutorial-1-basic-install","title":"Installing Otomi","description":"To go through the tutorials, you first need to install Otomi on a running Kubernetes cluster."},"tutorial-10-create-ksvc-otomi":{"id":"tutorial-10-create-ksvc-otomi","title":"Create and expose a Knative service with Otomi","description":"In his tutorial, we are going to create a Knative service with Otomi Console and publicly expose it."},"tutorial-3-push-harbor":{"id":"tutorial-3-push-harbor","title":"Build, tag and push an image to Harbor","description":"When Otomi is installed without using Let\'s Encrypt production certificates, make sure you download the CA.crt, added it to your Keychain and restarted Docker."},"tutorial-4-create-svc":{"id":"tutorial-4-create-svc","title":"Create a Kubernetes service","description":"In this tutorial, we are going to deploy the image we pushed to harbor in the previous tutorial, by creating a Kubernetes Deployment and Service."},"tutorial-5-create-ksvc":{"id":"tutorial-5-create-ksvc","title":"Create a Knative service","description":"In this tutorial, you are going to deploy the image you build, tagged and pushed to harbor in the previous tutorial by creating a Knative service."},"tutorial-6-expose-svc":{"id":"tutorial-6-expose-svc","title":"Publicly expose an existing service with Otomi","description":"In his tutorial, we are going to publicly expose a service we created in one of the previous tutorials."},"tutorial-7-create-secret":{"id":"tutorial-7-create-secret","title":"Create a secret in Hashicorp Vault","description":"In his tutorial, you are going to create a secret in Hashicorp Vault."},"tutorial-8-add-secret":{"id":"tutorial-8-add-secret","title":"Securely add a secret to Kubernetes","description":"In his tutorial, you are going to deploy the secret created in Hashicorp Vault to Kubernetes via Otomi Secrets so the secret can be used by the team."},"tutorial-9-use-secret":{"id":"tutorial-9-use-secret","title":"Use secrets in Kubernetes","description":"In his tutorial, you are going to use the secret created in Hashicorp Vault and added to Kubernetes using the Otomi Secrets feature in a Kubernetes deployment."},"tutorial-overview":{"id":"tutorial-overview","title":"Tutorial Overview","description":"This section contains tutorials to learn using Otomi and all the integrated apps."},"ui-all-jobs":{"id":"ui-all-jobs","title":"Platform - Jobs","description":"All known Jobs on the platform are listed here.
