The **Apps** section lists all the apps available to the otomi-admin role. The shortcuts provide direct access to the app in the cluster context.

For each installed App there are potentially three options/buttons:

- **Info**: [COMING SOON] View information about the app and use/edit shortcut URLs.
- **Play**: Open the app's default landing page.
- **Configure**: [COMING SOON] Configure the app's settings
