Loki aggregates all the container logs from the platform and stores them in a storage endpoint of choice (defaults to PVC). When Otomi is installed in multi-tenancy mode (see [settings/otomi](/docs/console/settings#otomi)) it will split logs from team namespaces and make them available only to team members.

Otomi provides Loki shortcuts to selections of logs based on interest.
