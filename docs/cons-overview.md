The Otomi CE Console (Community Edition) gives a read-only interface that shows the following:

- The logged in user and the teams belonging to, allowing to switch team operating for.
- The settings in use by the cluster: software version
- The list of clusters in use by Otomi, allowing to switch to another cluster's console and thus, apps to work with.
- The list of admin applications (if admin) and a list of team applications (if team to operate for is chosen).
