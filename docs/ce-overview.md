## Community Edition (FREE)

The Otomi CE does not offer self-service forms for Teams, Services, Secrets and Jobs. Configuring Otomi in CE mode is done by changing the configuration in the `otomi/values` repository. This section provides instructions and examples to get started in CE mode.

- Create and manage [Teams](teams)
- Create and manage [Services](services)
- Create and manage Secrets
- Create and manage Jobs

Otomi CE also includes the Otomi Console, but the self-service forms are not available. Otomi Console in CE mode does provide role based access to all integrated applications. When a team is created, team-members can use Otomi Console to view container logs and metrics. Teams also get access to a project in Harbor and a space in Hashicorp Vault.

See the following pages to explore Otomi Console in CE mode:

- Platform Apps for the otomi-admin role
- Team Apps for the team members
