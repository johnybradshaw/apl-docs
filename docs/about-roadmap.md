We are currently working on the following features for the next release. We release every 2 months.

For the next release (end of february) we aim to incorporate the following features:

- Jobs: already used in core, but made available for teams
- Continuous Deployment: semver/glob based image tags scanned in registry are deployed automatically and state is written back to values repo
- [EE only] Upgrade channels: subscribe a cluster to ALPHA/BETA/STABLE channel to automatically receive updates, or approve manually after
- Catalog with stateful applications: preconfigured flavours of availability vs affordability to meet current needs. First arrivals are likely to be MySQL, Redis, Postgres and Mongo
