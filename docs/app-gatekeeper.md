Otomi uses Gatekeeper for policy enforcement. Gatekeeper can be turned on or off. When turned on, individual policies can be switched on or off. Please see the [OPA Gatekeeper policy library](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper-library) as it is the source for the policy baseline here. We made a selection of usable policies for Otomi and adapted them to be used by Conftest as well for static analysis of manifests generated by Otomi.

The policies are provided as a best-practice security baseline. The full set of all policies can be found [here](https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-core/tree/master/policies).

Customization of the policies is supported based on the Otomi [schema](https://github.com/redkubes/otomi-core/blob/master/values-schema.yaml) (or use Otomi Console). In case of specific requirements, admins can add their own custom policies.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

It is possible to deviate from the baseline, provided there is a substantiated reason for doing so. To deviate from the baseline, annotations for the pod spec can be configured. Gatekeeper always keeps a log and thus it is traceable when an annotation is used. The use of annotations is a specific Otomi feature.

### Enable Gatekeeper

If not enabled during install, you can enable Gatekeeper Operator by editing the `values/env/charts/gatekeeper-operator.yaml` file and set enabled to true:

```yaml
charts:
  gatekeeper-operator:
    enabled: true
```
