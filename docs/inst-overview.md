## Experimentation & evaluation

For experimentation and evaluation purposes, use the quickstart for Azure, Google Cloud Platform and AWS to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in your cloud of choice and install Otomi with minimal values. Go to the [quickstart](https://github.com/redkubes/quickstart) repository on Github to get started.

After installing Otomi, perform the [post-installation steps](post-install).

When installing Otomi with minimal values (using the quickstarts) you can not use the tutorials.
