The Otomi CLI offers commands for installing Otomi and working with Otomi Values. The current CLI will soon be replaced with a new one (ported from bash to Javascript) for better portability. The new CLI is now available in preview and we're hoping to migrate soon.

Choose your CLI:

- [Current Otomi CLI](/docs/cli/current)
- [New Otomi CLI](/docs/cli/new)
