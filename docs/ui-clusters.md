![Platform clusters](img/platform-clusters.png)

All known Otomi clusters are listed here. Clusters can be sorted based on:

| Property | Description                                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provider | The configured Otomi provider (`AWS`, `Azure`, `Google` or `Custom`) |
| Name     | The name of the cluster                                               |
| URL      | The URL of the Otomi Console of the cluster                           |

Kubernetes clusters running Otomi can be grouped by adding additional clusters. This enables to switch context between clusters by selecting `Cluster` in the top bar. See the [Platform Settings](settings) section for more information.
