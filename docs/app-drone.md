Otomi uses Drone to deploy changes to the values repo. As such, it is installed and configured by default. When no source control is configured, Otomi will deploy Gitea as Drone's git hosting dependency.

You may use Otomi's installment of Drone for other purposes if so desired, with the limitation that it can't be configured for multiple git repos.
