All known Builds on the platform are listed here. Builds can be sorted based on:

| Property      | Description                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Build         | The name of the build                                  |
| Team          | The name of the Team responsible for the build         |

A platform admin can also create builds. Make sure to select the correct context (team-name) in the top bar. See [here](/docs/for-devs/console/builds) for more information about creating builds.

Follow the instructions [here](../../for-devs/console/builds.md) to create a build.
