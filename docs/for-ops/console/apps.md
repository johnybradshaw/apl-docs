The apps section lists all apps available to the otomi-admin role. The apps section is devided into 2 parts:

### Disabled apps

The disabled apps are available for users to activate. Drag and drop the app to the enabled section to activate the app. This will install the app based on the Otomi default configuration.

### Enabled apps

After installing Otomi, only the Core apps will be active and visable in the enabled apps section. Core apps have white names. Optional apps have yellow (in light mode) or red (in dark mode) names.

## App configuration

By hoovering over the apps, a configuration item will appear. The app configuration section will show (if applicable) the following tabs:

### Info

Here you will find more information about the app and how the app is integrated into Otomi.

### Shortcuts

### Values

### Raw values
