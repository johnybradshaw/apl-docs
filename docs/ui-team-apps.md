![Team apps](img/team-apps.png)

**Apps** Lists all the apps available to the Team. The team apps give direct access to the team context in that app on that cluster. When a user is not given the otomi-admin or team-admin role, the user will not see the Platform section and Otomi Console will be blue (instead of red when logged in as a otomi-admin or team-admin).

For each installed App there are three options/buttons:

- **Settings**: [COMING SOON] Change the settings for this app.
- **Play**: Run the app.
- **Help**: [COMING SOON] Get more info about this app.
