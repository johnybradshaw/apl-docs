![Team apps](img/team-apps.png)

**Apps** Lists all the apps available to the Team. The team apps give direct access to the team context in that app on that cluster. When a user is not given the otomi-admin or team-admin role, the user will not see the Platform section and Otomi Console will be blue (instead of red when logged in as a otomi-admin or team-admin).

For each installed App there are three options/buttons:

- **Info**: [COMING SOON] View information about the app and use/edit shortcut URLs.
- **Play**: Open the app's default landing page.
