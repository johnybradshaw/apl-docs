Alertmanager is configured by Otomi to use the global values found under settings' [home](/docs/console/settings#alerts) and [home-alerts](/docs/console/settings#home-alerts).

A team may decide to override some or all of them, in order to have alerts sent to their own endpoints. Self-service rights to alerting must be enabled for that team (enabled by default for all teams).
