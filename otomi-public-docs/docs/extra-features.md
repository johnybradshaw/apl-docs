Extra features

Next to all integrated open source solutions, Otomi Stack offers the following extra features:

Team onboarding Easily onboard new teams. Otomi Stack will automatically create a namespace with default policies that you can customize, provide a CD token, create a team dashboard and configure ingress.

Team dashboards A team dashboard provides access to tools like Grafana, Prometheus and Alert Manager, but only shows data of objects within the team namespace.

Admin dashboard The admin dashboard provides access to apps like Grafana, Prometheus, Alert Manager and Weave Scope (and others) and shows data of all cluster resources.

Single Sign-on Team members are provided access to a team dashboard using Azure AD / LDAP groups.

Integrated CI/CD Teams can get access to a dedicated GitLab CI or Drone instance and a private container registry.

Team Slack channels Configure Alert Manager to send team notifications to a dedicated Slack channel.
